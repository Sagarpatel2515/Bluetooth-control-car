# Bluetooth-control-car
This project showcases a car that can be controlled remotely using a Bluetooth connection and a mobile app. By connecting a Bluetooth module to a microcontroller, users can send commands to control the car's movements—forward, backward, left, or right—through their smartphone.

# Project Overview
The Bluetooth-Controlled Car allows users to control the car wirelessly with the help of a smartphone app. The car's directions are managed by sending commands from the phone to the car via Bluetooth, making it a fun and interactive project for learning about wireless communication, motor control, and microcontroller programming.

# Key Features
Bluetooth Control: Connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth for wireless control.
Mobile App Integration: Works with any Bluetooth terminal or custom app for easy control.
Direction Control: Moves the car forward, backward, left, and right based on received commands.
Microcontroller-Based: Built using a microcontroller (like Arduino) to receive Bluetooth commands and control the motors.

# How to Use
Clone this repository and upload the provided code to your microcontroller.
Connect the Bluetooth module and motors to the microcontroller as per the wiring diagram.
Pair your smartphone with the car’s Bluetooth module.
Use a Bluetooth terminal or custom app to send movement commands to the car.

# Requirements
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05)
Motor driver module
Smartphone with Bluetooth and a Bluetooth terminal app

# Applications
This project is a great hands-on learning experience for anyone interested in robotics, Bluetooth technology, and remote control systems. It’s also an engaging way to introduce wireless communication and motor control concepts.
